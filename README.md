# Hack-The-Future
## Problem statement
The solution should analyse the voice of the caller on live on-going calls being attended by the caller in the emergency Response System. After Analysing the voice of the caller, the solution should predict the emotional/ mental condition of the caller.it can predict whether the caller is in Stressful Voice, Abusive Voice ,Painful Voice Or any other mental condition.

## Introduction 
Our model's name is   AI LIFE-LINE which aims to detect the mental health status whether the caller is under depression , stress , having suicidal thoughts or abusive behaviour .
It is going to detect by four algorithms that is jitter effect , time spacing , pitch vs intensity graph analysis ,transcript and text analysis .
